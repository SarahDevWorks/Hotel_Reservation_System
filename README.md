# Hotel Reservation System

## Overview

The Hotel Reservation System is a Java-based application designed to manage hotel reservations efficiently. This system allows users to reserve rooms, view existing reservations, get room numbers based on reservation details, update reservations, and delete reservations. The application connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve reservation data.

## Features

- **Reserve a Room**: Allows users to reserve a room by entering guest details.
- **View Reservations**: Displays all current reservations in the system.
- **Get Room Number**: Retrieves the room number based on reservation ID and guest name.
- **Update Reservation**: Updates the details of an existing reservation.
- **Delete Reservation**: Deletes an existing reservation from the system.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- MySQL Database
- MySQL JDBC Driver

## Setup

### MySQL Database

1. Install MySQL and MySQL Workbench if not already installed.
2. Create a database named `hotel_db`.

    reservation_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
